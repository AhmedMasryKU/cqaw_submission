# The CVPR 2021 Chart Question Answering Challenge

We designed the CQA challenge to test how different algorithms can generalize across graphical perception stimuli.

The challenge includes 3 levels: from low-level visualization building blocks to semantic reasoning that requires text extraction.

## Data

We provide 3 datasets with increasing complexity. Each dataset includes training data with labels and testing data without labels.
